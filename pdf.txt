repository, up to you
Description:
There is a public SOAP web service available at: http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx
WSDL URL: http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL
You need to write a web service to create a REST JSON wrapper for SOAP service. All
SOAP service methods should be duplicated in the new REST service and in fact wrap the
source service methods in JSON.
Additional conditions are recording all requests and responses to logs and writing to a local
SQL database.
Logging to the database and log file should be performed with the obligatory observance of
the sequence of the entire call. That is, in the case of simultaneous execution of 2 calls, one
call is sequentially recorded in the log, then the other.
The log entries should be as follows:
[dd.MM HH:mm:ss] - Call 1. Request to JSON
[dd.MM HH:mm:ss] - Call 1. Request to SOAP
[dd.MM HH:mm:ss] - Call 1. Response from SOAP
[dd.MM HH:mm:ss] - Call 2. Request to JSON
[dd.MM HH:mm:ss] - Call 2. Request to SOAP
[dd.MM HH:mm:ss] - Call 2. Response from SOAP
By request and response are meant specific data received.
Database structure:
Additional (optional): creating Unit tests for the project
